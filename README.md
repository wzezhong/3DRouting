## Introduction
In recent years, with the advancement of biochip technology, MEDA, a biochip with smaller individual electrodes, has been widely used in biochemistry experiments such as DNA detection, protein analysis, PCR detection, etc. MEDA is one-tenth of the size of DMFB compared to traditional biochips such as DMFB. MEDA also allows for diagonal droplet movement, a feature that makes MEDA more flexible in biochemistry experiments and makes traditional DMFB-based routing algorithms unsuitable. It is for this reason that our lab proposes a 3D routing algorithm based on MEDA.
